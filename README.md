Based on Backbone Boilerplate
====================

This boilerplate is the product of much research and frustration.  Existing
boilerplates freely modify Backbone core, lack a build process, and are very
prescriptive; Backbone Boilerplate changes that.

Organize your application with a logical file structure, develop your
Models/Collections/Views/Routers inside modules, and build knowing you have
efficient code that will not bottleneck your users.

## Getting started ##

    $ npm install
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
